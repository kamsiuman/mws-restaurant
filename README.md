note :
-- the reason why the resturant tile is fix width is because the width is fix "Restaurant Listing" which the width is set to "270px;"
-- restaurants-list => flex-wrap: wrap; (important)
-- decide the split into 2 css files.. one for index and one for resturant. the reasons is I cannot find a better way to use the @media query to control different elements from diff files..also looks unorganize.
